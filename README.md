========================

When Math meets Tech -- you get Epic Stuff.   Apply a simple technique called Markov chains to create your own AI.


## Descriptions

Markov Chains and introductory Group Theory to machine learning and AI.


### Markov Chains and Group Theory

How do computers learn?  How do we learn?

Transitions and associations, emergent group closure within neural networks.  Group Theory: Convergent Markov Matrices.
