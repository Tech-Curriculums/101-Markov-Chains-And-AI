101-Markov-Chains-And-AI
========================

When Math meets Tech -- you get Epic Stuff.   Apply a simple technique called Markov chains to create your own AI.


## Descriptions

Markov Chains and introductory Group Theory to machine learning and AI.


### Markov Chains and Group Theory

How do computers learn?  How do we learn?

Transitions and associations, emergent group closure within neural networks.  Group Theory: Convergent Markov Matrices.

## Exercise 1

in this exercise, we create an transition matrix from observing, and then generate predictions based on those.

Training set's up to you, but we have many options.  Basically you just need to describe anything in terms of states and transitions.




## Exercise 2 Adaptive Transition Matrices.

In this activity, we level up our AI by allowing it to adjust it's initial guess with it's experience.

## Long-term Markov Matrices -- planning ahead
